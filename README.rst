====================
pyscaffoldext-django
====================


    Integration of **Django**'s built-in generator (``django-admin``)
    into **PyScaffold**

`PyScaffold`_ is a development tool focused in distributable Python packages.
This extension allows the development of `Django`_ websites using
PyScaffold sensible project structure, by tapping into the `django-admin`_ cli.

    **LOOKING FOR CONTRIBUTORS** - If you use PyScaffold or Django and would
    like to help us as a contributor (or even as one of the maintainers) for
    this extension, please send us an email or open an issue, we would love to
    have you on board.


Quickstart
==========

This extension can be directly installed with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pyscaffoldext-django

Or, if you prefer ``pipx``:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ pipx install pyscaffold  # if you haven't installed pyscaffold yet
   $ pipx inject pyscaffold pyscaffoldext-django

Note that, after the installation, ``putup -h`` will show a new option
``--django``. Use this option to indicate when you are trying to create a
django app. For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ putup --django myapp

Please refer to `django-admin`_ documentation for more details.


Alternative Procedure
=====================

Using Django extension in PyScaffold is roughly equivalent to first create
an app using `django-admin`_ and then convert it to PyScaffold.
The following manual procedure can be used to replace ``pyscaffoldext-django``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ django-admin startproject myapp
    $ mkdir myapp/src
    $ mv myapp/myapp myapp/src
    $ mv myapp/manage.py myapp/src/myapp/__main__.py

    # edit the location of the database in myapp/src/myapp/setttings.py
    # to point to one directory up, similar to:
    #
    #   PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname(BASE_DIR)
    #   DATABASES = {'default': { ..., 'NAME': os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, 'db.sqlite3')}}

    $ putup myapp --force

We move/rename the ``manage.py`` file to ``myapp/src/myapp/__main__.py``. This
makes it possible to manage the application using ``python -m myapp`` when
it is installed as a package (instead of ``python manage.py``).
All the arguments remain the same.
Please check the next section for more information.

Running the script with ``python -m`` requires your package to be installed
(a simple ``pip install -e .`` will suffice), however we also generate a new
``manage.py`` file that is a simple stub pointing to the ``__main__.py`` and
works without explicit installation.

For complex use cases, maybe a better option is to do the conversion
manually. If you find problems running PyScaffold with ``--django``
please try to execute this procedure.


Distributable Django Packages
=============================

Django is a framework for creating web applications, and PyScaffold is a tool
that helps to build re-usable, distributable packages - which most of the time
correspond to libraries or command line tools.

.. _dependencies:

While those two definitions are not mutually exclusive, it is a bit tricky to
create a package with PyScaffold that serves a Django app.
The first reason is that applications usually require concrete dependencies
(pinned version numbers), while libraries are more relaxed and tend to use
abstract dependencies (ranges of version numbers). You can read all about the
differences between those two approaches in `PyScaffold's documentation`_,
however the main point is: when creating packages for webapps you have two options

:Use concrete dependencies: pin the exact version number for your
  dependencies to avoid bugs (*it works on my machine*\ :sup:`TM`), but
  instruct your users that the package should be installed within a
  **dedicated** `virtual environment`_ to avoid dependency hell; or
:Use abstract dependencies: prefer relaxed dependency ranges (e.g. relying
  on stable APIs of  dependencies that use `semver`_), but test extensively
  your module against different installed versions to make sure nothing breaks
  (`tox`_ and `nox`_ are good tools for that).

.. _managepy:

The second reason is that Django expects the user of your application to have
control on where the source code is placed, and this simply doesn't go well with
pip installing locations deeply hidden somewhere in the file system (e.g.
``/home/username/my-venvs/web-app/lib/python3.6/site-packages/my-web-app``)…

For example, before starting a Django application server you are supposed to run
migrations to prepare the correct structure in the database to receive your
data. This is usually achieved by running ``python manage.py migrate`` at the
root of your directory, however, if someone is installing your app using pip,
how does this person knows where to find the ``manage.py`` file?

To solve this problem, ``pyscaffoldext-django`` renames ``manage.py`` to
|mainpy|_ and moves it inside your web application package. Since it becomes
part of your package, the script will be accessible via ``python -m YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME
<commands>`` from everywhere in the system, and therefore no one installing it
with pip needs to know where it is.

.. _database:

Another example of the same behaviour is the default SQLite database Django
creates. If you simply turn an Django app that was not created with PyScaffold into a
package, install it and run the migrations, Django will generate an SQLite file
in an arbitrary location in your disk. PyScaffold cannot automatically solve
this problem for you. Instead you can follow a few approaches:

#. (*NOT RECOMMENDED*) place your SQLite database inside your package and
   distribute it as a `package data`_, accessing it via `importlib.resources`_.
   (Please note resources are supposed to be immutable and not re-written to disk)
#. Allow the person installing your package to specify a different
   configuration via environment variables. According to the `Mozilla's
   tutorials`_, the library `dj-database-url`_ is good for that.
#. Place your SQLite database `somewhere in the user home`_.

For the sake of pragmatism, PyScaffold will reconfigure ``settings.py`` to
place the database inside the project root in the development environment, but
it is your responsibility to change this when going into production.

.. _multiple-apps:

Finally, it is important to notice that, while it is popular in the Django community
to create separated top-level folders for independent applications, this is more or less
incompatible with the concept of a Python package...
One entry in PyPI should install a single package in your machine. Ideally, if
you use `multiple apps`_, you should deploy a different package for each of
them and declare them as dependencies of your main project.
Alternatively you can also deploy new applications nested inside of your main
project package (the one generated by PyScaffold/``django-admin startproject``).
Therefore, caution is required when using ``python manage.py startapp`` (you
should either provide the optional ``directory`` parameter as somewhere inside
of your main package, or skip it completely).
One example on how to use nested apps is:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ putup --django website
    $ cd website
    # … do some coding
    $ mkdir src/website/subapp
    $ python manage.py startapp subapp src/website/subapp
    # OR python -m website startapp subapp src/website/subapp
    #    if you have the package installed in the dev environment
    # … then you can add "website.subapp" to INSTALLED_APPS in src/website/settings.py
    # … remeber to use relative imports or the full package name "website.subapp" when needed


Tips
====

#. Have a look on `Django's guides`_, but remember that PyScaffold already do
   the heavy lifting for you (no need to write packaging configuration from
   scratch) and that we use a `src-based layout`_
#. Do not assume anything about the file system where the package will be
   installed.
#. If you really need to write things to disk, you can follow the `XDG standards`_
   and write to ``$XDG_DATA_HOME`` (the package `appdirs`_ might help).
#. Accept configurations via environment variables, and throw meaningful errors
   when they are not provided. Even if you prefer reading configurations from a
   file, you can always let the person installing your package to specify a
   location for this file as an environment variable.
#. Use environment variables as flags/switches to enable/disable features or
   select alternative implementations.
#. Be extra careful to not store secrets and confidential info in your source
   repository.
#. Be extra careful with secrets and confidential info **IN GENERAL**.
   If really required to store them, use well known cryptography techniques and
   tweak file/folder permissions in your operating system (e.g. the command
   ``chmod og-rwx`` is your friend, but you can also consider ``400``
   permissions). Instructing the person installing your package to create a
   separated system account to run your web app with limited privileges might
   also be good.
#. Provide extensive documentation on how your users are supposed to install
   and run your app (e.g. virtualenv installation instructions,
   ngnix/apache/systemd configuration examples, etc...)
